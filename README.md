## Project Overview
**Road Accident Data Analysis | Excel Dashboard:**  This project showcases an analysis of road accident data using Excel. The key objective was to visualize and analyze accident casualties based on various factors like vehicle type, road conditions, and time of the day. A dashboard was created to represent key performance indicators (KPIs), providing insights into accident severity, casualty distribution, and trends over time.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard highlights the following KPIs, which help track and interpret road accident casualties:

**Primary KPI - Total Casualties:**
- Total number of casualties resulting from road accidents.
- Casualties categorized by severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight).
  
**Primary KPI - Total Casualties by Vehicle Type:**
- Total casualties and their percentage relative to accident severity.
- Maximum casualties by the type of vehicle involved (Car, Truck, Bus, Bicycle, etc.).
  
**Secondary KPI - Casualties by Vehicle Type:**
- Breakdown of casualties across different vehicle types.
  
**Secondary KPI -Monthly Trend Comparison:**
- Comparison of casualties for the current year (2022) and the previous year (2021).
- Visual representation of trends to identify periods with higher or lower accidents.
  
**Secondary KPI -Maximum Casualties by Road Type:**
- Analysis of road types (e.g., Single carriageway, Dual carriageway) to determine where the most casualties occur.
  
**Secondary KPI -Distribution by Road Surface:**
- Breakdown of casualties based on the road surface conditions (Dry, Wet, Icy).
  
**Secondary KPI -Casualties by Location and Light Condition:**
- Distribution of casualties by location (Urban vs. Rural areas) and by time of the day (Daylight vs. Dark).

## Data Source
This analysis was performed using a dataset of road accidents. Each row in the dataset represents an accident, with attributes like accident date, vehicle type, road type, surface condition, casualty severity, 
  and more.

## Project Dashboard
The dashboard, created in Excel, serves as the focal point of the project. It allows for dynamic filtering of data by accident date and location type, offering an interactive view of casualty trends and 
  distributions.

## Tools and Skills Used
  **Excel:** The primary tool used for data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.

  **Data Analysis Skills:**
  - Data visualization (charts, graphs).
  - KPI tracking and interpretation.
  - Trend analysis.
 
## How to Use the Dashboard
  **To interact with the dashboard:**
   - Open the Excel file containing the dashboard.
   - Use filters to adjust the date range or location type (Urban/Rural).
   - Analyze the results in terms of casualties by severity, vehicle type, road type, and surface condition.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to road accidents. The dashboard highlights key metrics, making it easy to identify trends and areas that require attention for road safety 
   improvements.
   
## Future Work
   - Expand the analysis to include more years of data.
   - Integrate advanced data analysis techniques using tools like Python or Power BI.
   - Compare accident data across different regions to identify geographical risk areas.
